# AlgoDailyDose 
A daily dose of algorithms &amp; data structures with full explanations, one problem at a time 🧠💊
---
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I:
- 🛠️ Solve **1+ algorithm or data structure problem daily**
- 🧾 Write detailed explanations so future me (or you!) gets it
- 🎯 Use this to prep for interviews & take a break from boring job application


## ❓ Why this exists
Job hunting for me is draining when I am just tossing resumes into the void. This repo is my way of:
- Staying sharp for online assessments and interviews
- Keeping learning fun and challenging
- Documenting my thought process and growth 🚀

## 🧩 Structure
Each problem is like a mini-adventure:
- 🚫📄 No problem descriptions (because respecting terms and conditions is cool 😎)
- 💡 A peek into my thought process (a.k.a. the "what was I thinking?!" moments)
- 🏁 The final code solution, sprinkled with comments for clarity and future me's(or potentially your) sanity

## ✍️ Logs

| Day | Problem | Topic | Notes | Difficulty | Solution Link |
|-----|---------|-------|-------|------------|---------------|

## Planned problems to complete some day 🚀

These are the "someday" problems, like that book you keep meaning to read or the gym membership you swear you'll use. One day, I'll crack these open and give them the attention they deserve. Until then, they sit here, taunting me. 😅

| Problem Name | Why left for future? |
|--------------|------------------|

## 📌 Sources I pull problems from:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/)
- Reddit r/algorithms, ...
- Anything I stumble on that seems interesting!

## 🤝 Contributions?
I mean, who in their right mind would want to contribute to someone else's interview prep grind? But hey, if you're feeling adventurous, go ahead and PR some spicy problems or quirky challenges. I won't stop you(probably!). 😏

## 🧃 Final Note
This is just as much a brain workout as it is therapy. If you're also stuck in job-hunting limbo, join the grind. We’ll hear back soon™ 😌
