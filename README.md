# AlgoDailyDose 
A daily dose of algorithms &amp; data structures with full explanations, one problem at a time üß†üíä
---
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I:
- üõ†Ô∏è Solve **1+ algorithm or data structure problem daily**
- üßæ Write detailed explanations so future me (or you!) gets it
- üéØ Use this to prep for interviews & take a break from boring job application


## ‚ùì Why this exists
Job hunting for me is draining when I am just tossing resumes into the void. This repo is my way of:
- Staying sharp for online assessments and interviews
- Keeping learning fun and challenging
- Documenting my thought process and growth üöÄ

## üß© Structure
Each problem is like a mini-adventure:
- üö´üìÑ No problem descriptions (because respecting terms and conditions is cool üòé)
- üí° A peek into my thought process (a.k.a. the "what was I thinking?!" moments)
- üèÅ The final code solution, sprinkled with comments for clarity and future me's(or potentially your) sanity

## ‚úçÔ∏è Logs

| Date | Problem | Source | Topic | Notes | Difficulty | Solution Link |
|------|---------|--------|-------|-------|------------|---------------|

## Planned problems to complete some day üöÄ

These are the "someday" problems, like that book you keep meaning to read or the gym membership you swear you'll use. One day, I'll crack these open and give them the attention they deserve. Until then, they sit here, taunting me. üòÖ
